This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a neural network implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The project begins by importing necessary libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenCV, Pillow, and TensorFlow. The dataset is loaded and preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to a range of 0 to 1. Sample images and their labels are visualized for better understanding. A Sequential neural network model is built with a Flatten layer to convert 2D images into 1D arrays, followed by two Dense layers with ReLU activation, and an output Dense layer with Sigmoid activation for multi-class classification. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric. Training is conducted over 10 epochs, resulting in a training accuracy of 98.9% and a test accuracy of 97.1%. Predictions are made on the test dataset, and a confusion matrix is generated to visualize performance across different digit classes. The project also includes a predictive system function, allowing users to load, preprocess, and predict handwritten digits from their own images. The model demonstrates high accuracy and effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits, making it a valuable tool for digit recognition tasks.
